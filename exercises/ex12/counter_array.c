/*
QUESTION TWO
There are synchronization errors, because approximately 1/10th of the
printed values are not cleanly divisble by 10,000. This means that when
the value was checked in the if statement, the counter was cleanly 
divisble by 10,000, but by the time it got to printing the value on the
next line, the counter value had been increased by one or more other
threads to a value that wasn't cleanly divisble by 10,000. The counter
should have been locked before the if statement and until it got
printed.
